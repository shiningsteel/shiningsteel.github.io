# \# About me
Dale Johnson, PhD, post-doc researcher at the Applied Psychoacoustics Laboratory at the University of Huddersfield. I enjoy learning about psychacoustics, concert hall acoustics, and perceptual audio. I love programming and I enjoy applying it to virtual acoustics modelling.
<br/>
I am a huge synth nerd, something which must have started when I started listening to electronic music. In my spare time I build electronics projects, take apart or modify things, make music, and do film photography.

# \# About this site
This site is a static site hosted on github-pages and is rendered using Jekyll. I can make new posts, tweaks, and edits from my own computer and push them to the repo. I see this as a more convenient method than using a much larger site builder website.

The theme is a fork of the Jekyll-Console theme
