# ./init

## {
Metal face initialised! "Hello Everything".
<br/>
For a while I have been thinking about creating a website for me to share and document my personal hobbies. You may have seen snippets and highlights of what I do on social media, but I am getting tired of using those platforms. Social media, with all of its perks, has some serious downsides and it is not my ideal way of sharing things. What you see on those are curated posts, and they do not tell the whole story, which for me is the fun part. Ironically, the best way to share this website is through social media, so whilst I have not fully escaped its grasp, I am still mostly away from it.
<br/>
So, this is what this website is going to be: a place for me to properly share my thoughts and projects, and a place for me to truly express who I am and not the way "The Zuck" wants me to (no blue F in sight here), or whatever some over complicated site builder thinks is best.
<br/>
P.S: Markdown for the win! Such a painless way to write and typeset.
